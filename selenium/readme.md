# Selenium Take Home Exercise

Welcome to the Selenium Take Home Exercise! This is an offline, take at home in your own time activity in which we are asking you, the Quality Engineer candidate, to complete in order to help give the interview team clarity on your experience and capabilities.

## Rules

Before you begin, please reach out to us confirming that you have a full Selenium local development environment set up. We will not count the setup of the environment in the time contraint in the overall exercise. If you haven't set up an environment, please stop reading and reach out to us, then set up your environment. Due to the nature of the exercise, we cannot assist you in setting up the environment. 

## Goals

In this exercise, we ask that you create:

- A Selenium test suite;
- User Stories which correspond to each of the create tests in the suite;
- **Minimum 2 (two) created test cases** for the suite;
- (If any) Bug reports for each of the defects found with the created test suite.

Feel free to create the test suite battery against any web site of your choosing. Remember, this test suite will showcase your understanding of various difficult aspects of web-based automated tests - show us all the interesting techniques you use to solve potentially gnarly problems with creating this type of automation.

Have fun! Be creative! We look forward to potentially meeting with you to discuss what you have created. Thank you for your time! <3
